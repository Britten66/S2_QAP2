# S2_QAP2

Here is a web project repo for my QAP 2

Author: Chris Britten
=======================================================================

Time Spent:
Around 18–20 hours total. This included a lot of debugging, testing
each task, and getting the HTML / JS connected right for outputs.

Resources Used:

- YouTube for refreshers on regex, building URLs, and DOM handling
- GOOGLE
- Stack Overflow for small fixes (like querySelector errors)
- MDN Web Docs for official syntax and examples
- Class notes from Keyin and examples from earlier labs

- Justin helped me out testing and figuring out some logic bugs
- Vanessa gave me pointers with validation and general review

Difficulty Rating:
8 / 10 – Honestly a pretty tough one. Lots of small moving parts,
validation checks, and edge cases that kept breaking things.
Good learning curve though once everything clicked.
